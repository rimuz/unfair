# Unfair
Though this is an **old project**, I wanted to share it here on GitHub.
Unfair is a simple game written in **C++11** using **SFML**. <br>
I gave it this name for his challenging difficulty which is pretty common for
**bullet-hell** games.

All indentation errors are due to a horrible text editor I used years ago D: <br>
And.. I apologize in advance for the *messy* and *bad* code :D
